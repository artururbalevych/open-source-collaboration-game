# Playbook C3: Example

## The workflow

A brief guide on how to contribute to the CoLRev project documentation is available [here](contribute-to-docs.md).

## Your changes

You have worked with a few programming libraries before and you know that it is helpful to have a few examples that show how to use the library. You found out that the following commands are required to complete a literature review:

```
   colrev init
   colrev retrieve
   colrev prescreen
   colrev pdfs
   colrev screen
   colrev data

```

However, the documentation is missing a page displaying how to get started and there is limited information on what these commands do. You decide to create an "Example" page, which should display the commands in a code block and explain what they do.

Use web resources like this [guide](https://guides.lib.utexas.edu/c.php?g=1060589&p=7710319) to add short explanations. You can add explanations to the code block using th `#` symbol.
