# Playbook C6: FAQ

## The workflow

A brief guide on how to contribute to the CoLRev project documentation is available [here](contribute-to-docs.md).

## Your changes

One thing you appreciate in Open-Source projets is the FAQ section. You believe that the CoLRev project would benefit from such a section. The FAQ section should contain the following questions:

- Can I use CoLRev without Docker?
- Can I use CoLRev on MacOS?
- For which review types can I use CoLRev?

Include tentative answers to these questions and encourage others to contribute to the FAQ section. Also include a link to Stack Overflow, which can be a great place to ask questions about Open-Source projects.
