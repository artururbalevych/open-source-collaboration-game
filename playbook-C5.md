# Playbook C5: Contribution guidelines

## The workflow

A brief guide on how to contribute to the CoLRev project documentation is available [here](contribute-to-docs.md).

## Your changes

You believe that the CoLRev project would benefit from explicit contribution guidelines. From other Open-Source projects, you know that these guidelines typically cover rules for the community as well as rules for the development of code. The contribution guidelines page should therefore contain two parts:

- A code of conduct for the community (based on the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) example)
- Rules for the development of code (requiring unit tests as well as the use of the [pylint]() and [mypy]() linters)
